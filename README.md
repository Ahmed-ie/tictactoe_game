Hi,

This is a basic tic tac toe game where two players can play. I first had this idea a long time ago, but I wanted to mention that I did quite some independent research
kept running into issues when I was developing this game. I found some of the concepts in real python project and discuss of tictac toe helpful, as
I was often able to read my issue.

These are some of the features

1. Starting feature, to start the player has to click on p and the game starts
2. Like a typical tic tac toe game, the game keeps track of the winning conditions
3. It will display at the end whether player x won, player o won, or if it was a tie
